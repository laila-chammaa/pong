Following [Pong - Lecture 0 - CS50's Introduction to Game Development 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfwpRU0cT10&list=PLhQjrBD2T383Vx9-4vJYFsJbvZ_D17Qzh&index=2)


Implemented [assignment 1](https://cs50.harvard.edu/games/2018/projects/0/pong/)

Implement an AI-controlled paddle (either the left or the right will do) such that it will try to deflect the ball at all times. Since the paddle can move on only one axis (the Y axis), you will need to determine how to keep the paddle moving in relation to the ball.
